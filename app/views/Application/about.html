		<h3>About:</h3><br/>
		<p>LiveDoc is a unique of sharing documents. When you share a LiveDoc with someone you can be assured that the other person will always have the updated version of the document.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>How it works?</b><br/>
You create a normal word 2007 document and upload it to LiveDoc site. LiveDoc gives two versions of the file.
			<ul>
				<li><b>Public Copy:</b> You can download this and share this. When this document is opened it will check in the server if any update is available and download the latest version. So you always have the updated copy.</li>
				<li><b>Private Copy:</b> This is the word document that you will keep with yourself. After you make any changes to the document, click the sync button and it will update the changes to the server.</li>			
			</ul>
			<br/>
			LiveDoc relies on macro of Microsoft word. So it is important that you turn on macro on the document for LiveDoc to work.
